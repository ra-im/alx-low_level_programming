# Here is a desccription of what each script in this directory does.

- `0-main.c`: Tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0, based on a predefined `maim.c` file.
- `1-main.c`: Comments out the part of a predefined `main.c` file code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
- `2-largest_number.c`: Fixes the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly  prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- `3-print_remaining_days.c`: Fixes the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
